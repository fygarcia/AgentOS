Memory Skills Package for AgentOS

This package provides memory management tools that agents can use to:
- Update their current status (NOW.md)
- Log activities and thoughts (LOG.md)
- Recall long-term memories (ChromaDB)
- Save and retrieve user facts (SQLite)

These are "native skills" of AgentOS - all agents have access to them.
